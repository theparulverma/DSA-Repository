Subject: Request for Consideration: Unable to Attend OOSD CT due to Dog Bite 

Dear [HOD's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I, Parul Verma, a student in the CSIT department, am facing a medical emergency that prevents me from attending the Object-Oriented Software Development Continuous Test (CT) scheduled for [13/10/2023].

Unfortunately, I sustained a leg injury due to a dog bite, and my doctor has advised me to rest and avoid any unnecessary stress or movement to ensure a speedy recovery. Regrettably, this means that I won't be able to participate in the upcoming OOSD CT as originally planned.

I understand the importance of this assessment and its impact on my academic progress, and I am truly committed to maintaining my academic performance. I kindly request your understanding and consideration in this matter. I request you to grant me permission to give make-up exams,as per your guidance.


Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours Truthfully,

Parul Verma
